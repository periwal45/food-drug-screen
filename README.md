Data analysis of food-drug combination screening against gut microbes

This repository contains all codes used for analyzing and processing of growth curve data obtained from screening of food compounds and drugs against a panel of gut microbes.

1. parse_reader_data.pl

Perl script to parse out reader data generated by (Gen5 software). Reads all folders and sub-folders to clean raw data and formats it in tab-separated files output files

2. GC_fitting.R

Reads in .tab reader data and fits logistic growth curve using GrowthCurver.

- annotates all plates with meta information such as plate no, replicate no, well, drug name
- fits logistic growth curve on each well of a 96-well plate
- writes out file of all fitted parameters for the whole screen

3. Plotting_GrowthCurves.R

Reads fitted parameter files to plot all fitted growth curves drug wise for each bug. All replicates are plotted in single plot for better visual assessment of the whole screen.

4. Correlation_analysis.R

contains code to perform correlation analysis amongst replicates and plots final correlation figures
